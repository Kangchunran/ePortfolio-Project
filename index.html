        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          My name is Chunran Kang, and I am currently a first-year student at Nova Scotia Community College pursuing a diploma in IT Database Administration.
          I have always been interested in the field of technology, and I am excited to be learning about databases and how they work.
          My goal is to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in this field and hopefully secure a job in IT database administration upon graduation.
          I am passionate about problem-solving and enjoy working with data, and I believe that this program will equip me with the necessary tools to pursue a career in this field.
          </p>
  
          <p>
          I have developed foundations in programming languages such as Java and Python, as well as SQL database
          management. I have also completed coursework in data analysis by using Tableau, which has further
          developed my analytical and problem-solving skills.
          Having all the knowledge of database and programming, I can assist in the development and
          implementation of data optimization, support database backup and recovery processes.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition, I have 4 years working experience as driving instructor and 4 years as realtor to my technical
          skills, my strong communication and teamwork abilities can help your team growth. I am a proactive
          problem solver with excellent analytical, which allow me to quickly identify issues and provide solutions.
          I have participated in group where I have collaborated with team members to achieve common goals. I am
          confident that these skills will enable me to contribute effectively to your team.
